<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
    With increasing use of data-driven methodologies, concerns around data discovery, data access, and data interoperability have come to the forefront. Communities have convened to work towards convergence of three complementary visions: (1) FAIR Data Principles, (2) Linked Data and Semantic Web, (3) Digital Object Architecture. This convergence has established the <a href="https://www.go-fair.org/today/fair-digital-framework/">FAIR Digital Object Framework</a>. This project is a demonstration project, which aims to leverage Digital Object Architecture and Semantic Web technologies to improve the FAIRness of materials data and metadata. If you would like to learn more about FAIR Digital Object Framework as applied to materials science and engineering, please <a href="https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/facilitating-adoption-fair-digital-object-framework-material-science/">click here</a>.
