<ol>
<li>The Material Data Hub Materials is a community supported resource, and will only be used in support of the sharing and dissemination of scientific data.</li>

<li>Content uploaded to this server will be available to the general public, under suitable license terms selected by the provider. The server will advise downloaders of the license status of hosted content, but Material Data Hub takes no responsibility for license enforcement. This is the responsibility of the original data provider.</li>
<li>Content that is part of private/unpublished collections or communities will be protected by available technological mechanisms associated with the repository software. Material Data Hub does not guarantee that these protection mechanisms will prevent all forms of unauthorized access. Content requiring more stringent guarantees of protection should not be stored on this system.</li>

<li>While every effort is made to ensure the integrity of data deposited on the Material Data Hub, Material Data Hub does not guarantee data integrity on this system.</li>
<li>Accounts are assigned to single users. Account holders may not share account credentials with others, or allow others to access their sessions, except system operators, who may require such access for maintenance purposes.</li>
<li>A user who has submitting or administrative rights to the system and who abuses their authority, or has some change in status that disqualifies them for the role, can have their submitter or administrative rights revoked by Material Data Hub management.</li>
<li>Material Data Hub may monitor system activities or view data uploaded to the server, and may disclose these activities or data for any lawful Government purpose.</li>
<li>Material Data Hub remains committed to the operation of public data repositories. Material Data Hub may discontinue this service at any time in favor of superior options. Any anticipated discontinuation of service will be announced in advance.</li>
