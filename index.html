description: "The mission of Material Data Hub is to complement the excellent work of Aflow, Materials Project, OQMD, and others by providing a FAIR Digital Object Repository for Experimental data and metadata. While we are specifically targeting material microstructure and process-structure-property relationships, this repository is open to broad contributions from the materials science and engineering community. The development of this portal is led by the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This development is a direct response to the NSF-Sponsored Report on Materials Data Infrastructure (MDI), and two NSF-Sponsored microstructure repository workshops lead by Lehigh University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This development responds to MDI recommendation #4 concerning demonstration projects and begins to implement the best practices and minimum metadata requirements identified during the microstructure repository workshops."
